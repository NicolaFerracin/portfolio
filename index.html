          <p>I joined Raisin in 2016 as a junior frontend developer and in the years I've been working here I've had the chance to grow immensely as a developer up to becoming a software engineer and I got the opportunity to tackle interesting problems together with my team.</p>
          <h4>## Responsiveness ~ 2016/2017</h4>
          <p>
            Brought the Online Banking Application to mobile users, applying responsive web design techniques across all pages, starting from a completely non-responsive state.
          </p>
          <h4>## Investment Products ~ 2017/2018</h4>
          <p>
            Used the development of a new line of products as a chance to move away from the legacy monolith Java/JSP frontend/backend application. Start anew with a React application communicating with the backend via a RESTful API.
          </p>
          <h4>## React migration ~ 2018/2019</h4>
          <p>
            The Investment Products React app was so well received by different teams in the company and by the customers that my team was tasked with migrating the whole Java/JSP app over to React. The project accomplished the full decoupling of frontend and backend, which resulted in a smoother development process of the app, higher maintainability, less bugs and improvement in hiring thanks to the use of modern technologies.
          </p>
          <h4>## Testing ~ 2018/2019</h4>
          <p>
            The migration to React gave my team the opportunity to drastically improve test coverage of our codebase: we manage to bring it from single digit to over 70%.
          </p>
          <h4>## Working Remotely ~ 2018/2019/2020</h4>
          <p>
            In January 2018 I started working remotely full-time while living in different cities around the world. Even with considerable time difference of up to 9 hours, I was always able to deliver features, meet deadlines and be an active part of my team. 2020 is my third year as a remote member of my team.
